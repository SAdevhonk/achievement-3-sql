## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Writing complex SQL queries
- Using JOINs across multiple tables
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Aggregations and filtering
- Query formatting and documentation

## Repository Contents
This repository contains selected SQL queries that demonstrate more advanced techniques, such as joins and subqueries.  
Each SQL file includes comments explaining the purpose of the query and the logic used.

## Additional Notes
This repository is intended to showcase SQL proficiency and analytical thinking rather than raw datasets.
